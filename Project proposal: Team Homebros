Predicting Housing Resale Prices
â”€
By Home Bros: Jing-Xuan Andrel, Jinal Surana, Shah Aashka Anand, Asha Meredith Solomon, Saamiya Khan

Overview 
We will be utilizing datasets from data.gov.sg containing true values of housing resale prices, as well as other continuous attributes to conduct supervised learning to predict housing resale prices.
Data Collection
Resale Flat Prices | HDB | data.gov.sg
Real GDP
Unemployment Rate (End Of Period), Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted | SINGSTAT | data.gov.sg
Population Size
Data Preprocessing
The attributes we will be referencing from the datasets are: 
Area Square Meters
Flat Type
Month of Sale
Remaining Lease
Real GDP (annual)
Flat Model
Population
Unemployment rate
Distance to CBD
Feature Engineering
We will use the scikit-learn Standard Scaler
Model Selection & Training
Linear Regression
RandomForestRegressor
XGboost Regressor
Optuna/gridsearchcv (hyperparameter tuning) 
Model Evaluation
Test/Validation/Training split of 70/15/15 to be used 
(Data from 1990-2009 to be trained on, 2010-2014 for hyperparameter tuning and 2015-2019 to be tested on)
Desired Outcome 
Lowest possible MAE (mean absolute error)
Analysis of MAE across years/towns
Feature Importance Ranking (determine which feature affects the prediction most) - SHAP Analysis
